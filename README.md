# 🌐 Full-Stack React & Spring Boot Project

This repository contains a **full-stack web application** that combines a modern **React frontend** with a robust **Java Spring Boot backend**.

The goal of this project is to:

- ✅ Apply and showcase my frontend development skills using **React** (which I already know and have production-level experience with).
- 🚀 Learn, apply, and demonstrate strong backend development skills using **Java** and the **Spring ecosystem**.
- 🔗 Integrate both ends into a clean, scalable, and maintainable full-stack application.

## 🧠 Why This Project?

As an aspiring **full-stack developer**, this project serves as a practical portfolio piece to demonstrate:

- My ability to build a complete web application from frontend to backend
- My understanding of **RESTful APIs**, **Java/Spring Boot**, and **React**
- My readiness for professional roles in **Java + React** development

---

## 🚧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (with hooks, functional components, and modern tooling)
- **Backend**: Java 21, Spring Boot, REST API, Spring Data JPA
- **Database**: (TBD – PostgreSQL / H2 for dev)
- **Dev Tools**: Maven, Git, GitHub, VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA, WSL2 Ubuntu
- **Deployment**: To be added (Docker / CI/CD pipeline optional)

## 🎯 Status

This project is currently in development. The frontend is scaffolded and connected, and I am actively building out the backend while deepening my Java and Spring Boot knowledge.

Stay tuned for updates as I progress through building endpoints, securing the API, and connecting everything into a seamless user experience.
